# Kibo Betting App

Kibo premier league is here! We're building a football betting app for Kibo. Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game. In this challenge we're gonna work with the data. So here are your tasks:

ðŸš¨ **_Please read the following tasks carefully before starting_** ðŸš¨

- Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and 'players2')
- The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field players. For Squad 4 (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10 field players
- Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22 players)
- During the game, Squad 4 (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus 'Olamide', 'James' and 'Bayo'
- Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
- Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player names (NOT an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)
- The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the console which team is more likely to win, WITHOUT using an if/else statement or the ternary operator.

ðŸš¨ **_This task requires you to make use of destructring, spread opeator, rest pattern and Short Circuiting (&& and ||)_** ðŸš¨

Use starter code to start the task, and **final code to compare it with your own code whenever something doesn't work**!
